Homework for the eighteenth lesson

Task 1.
We created a collection of the ArrayList class and filled it with random elements of type Integer.
Using Streams, the program can:
- Remove duplicates
- Print all even elements in the range from 7 to 17 (inclusive)
- Each element multiplied by 2
- Sort and display the first 4 elements
- Display the number of elements in the stream
- Display the arithmetic mean of all numbers in the stream


Task 2.
We have created a collection of the ArrayList class with the values ​​of the names of the students in the group.
Using Streams, the program selects all names starting with "a" (regardless of upper/lower case letters), and also sorts and returns the first element of the collection.
